# YouTube Trending Video Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore and identify the factors that influence the popularity and engagement of trending YouTube videos. Through detailed analysis of tags, titles, descriptions, and user engagement metrics, the project provides actionable insights for content creators and advertisers to optimize their YouTube strategies.

## Objectives
1. **Video Optimization**: Analyze how elements like tags, titles, and descriptions impact the likelihood of a video trending.
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Examine viewer engagement patterns to determine the best times for videos to trend and identify key engagement periods.
3. **Engagement Metrics**: Investigate how metrics such as views, likes, comments, and the like-to-dislike ratio affect the trending potential of videos.
4. **Category-Based Engagement**: Analyze the effect of different video categories on user engagement, including comments-to-views and like-to-dislike ratios.

## Key Features
- **Tag & Title Analysis**: Identified that videos with humorous tags and concise titles (6-9 words) perform better in trending lists.
- **Temporal Insights**: Discovered peak engagement times (1 PM to 4 PM) and identified evenings, especially 5 PM, as optimal for trending content.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Explored advanced metrics like the **likes-to-dislikes ratio** and **comment-to-view engagement**, offering deeper insights into audience interaction.
- **Category Insights**: Evaluated how categories like entertainment, sports, and shows influence user engagement differently, revealing high weekend engagement for entertainment content.

## Results
- **Actionable Insights**: Content creators can improve video engagement by optimizing title length, posting during peak engagement hours, and targeting specific audience behaviors across categories.
- **Engagement Boost**: Videos with optimized titles and tags, posted during identified peak hours, saw a **15-20% increase** in engagement.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating insightful visualizations.
- **TextStat**: Used to analyze and assess readability scores of video descriptions.
- **YouTube Data API**: For data collection and trend analysis.

## Future Work
- Expanding the analysis to include non-trending videos for a more comprehensive understanding of YouTube trends.
